This application provides essential video-sharing platform functionalities, allowing users to browse, watch, and search for videos. Offering a YouTube-like experience, it enables users to discover, watch, and share videos. Additionally, it includes features such as content recommendations and spell-check suggestions to enhance the user experience.

Home Page and Categories: The application's main page features a "sideNav" or side navigation panel, similar to YouTube's left-hand side. From this panel, users can access various categories (e.g., "Music," "Sports," "Entertainment," etc.). When users click on these categories, a list of videos related to the selected category is displayed.

Video Viewing: When users want to view a specific video, they can click on the video to access its details. The video detail page includes the video's title, description, and a video player. Users can watch the video on this page.

Related Videos: On the video detail page, users can also see other videos that are similar to the one they are currently watching. This provides access to related content that may interest the user.

Search Functionality: Users can search for specific keywords or phrases using the search bar. Search results present a list of videos that match the user's entered keyword, making it easy to find relevant content.

Correction Suggestions (didYouMean): When a user misspells a word or enters an incorrect keyword, the application offers possible correction suggestions through the "didYouMean" section. This helps users find the correct video they are looking for.
